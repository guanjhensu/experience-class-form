# Airbnb Clone with React, Hook, styled-components (Progress: 70%)

Hi! This is a project made by Chloe for studying purpose. The original page I try to mimic is: [Airbnb Online Experience](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1729648)

## See the website!
https://experience-class-form.herokuapp.com

## Tools I use in this project
CSS：[styled-components](https://styled-components.com)

Javascript：ES6+, [React](https://reactjs.org) (with [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html))

Images inside the projects are fetched from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) with [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)

Fake data (such as "Comments") are fetched from [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

All icons are found in [ICONFINDER](https://www.iconfinder.com)

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. (You will also see any lint errors in the console.)

ps. You need to use your own Unsplash API key to load the images successfully. You can put the API key in src/api/UnsplashAPI.js
